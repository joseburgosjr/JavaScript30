    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;

    age = 200;

    console.log(age, age2);
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team = players;
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(players);
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    console.log(team2);
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'Luna';
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
      name: 'Jose B',
      age: 30
    };
    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:
    const person2 = person;
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person3 = Object.assign({}, person);

    person2.name = 'Jose A';
    person3.name = 'Jose C';

    console.log(person, person2, person3);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
